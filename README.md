# DevOps-Milestone2: Test and Analysis

Team Members:

1. Ayush Gupta - agupta25@ncsu.edu
2. Nishtha Garg - ngarg@ncsu.edu
3. Shivam Gulati - sgulati2@ncsu.edu

We have used Jenkins to configure the build server. Alongwith Jenkins, we have used Tomcat, Git for Source Code Management and NPM as a package manager.

We used the MIT licensed Climbing-Grade project which is forked at 
```
https://github.com/shivamgulati1991/climbing-grade.
```

#### Jenkins Job Creation Steps


1. Create a new job. Give it a name. Choose Freestyle Project.
2. For configuration of Job
   Source Code Management-> select Git under Source Code Management-> Enter your project's Git Repository URL.
3. Under Build Environment-> select "Provide Node & npm bin/ folder to PATH"-> choose the NodeJS installation.
4. Additionally, you can also setup multiple branches for the same job.
5. Click Save.
5. Test run a build - Go to Jobs and click "Build Now". 

### Test Section

#### Test Suites: The ability to run unit tests, measure coverage, and report the results.

We used Istanbul code coverage with tests and Cobertura Jenkins plugin to display the report.

1. Go to Manage Jenkins->Manage Plugin->Install Cobertura plugin.
2. Go to your Job -> Configure.
	1. In  Build -> Execute Shell , write this code.
```
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm test
```
	2. In Post-build section, select Publish Cobertura Coverage Report and give this report path which is generated by istanbul

```
**/coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml
```

3. Click Save.
4. Build the job

#### Advanced Testing: Implement one of the following advanced testing techniques: test priorization, test case generation, fuzzing, or flaky test quarantine.

1. Create a new job. Give it a name. Choose Freestyle Project.

2. For configuration of Job
   Source Code Management-> select Git under Source Code Management-> Enter your project's Git Repository URL.
3. Under Build Environment-> select "Provide Node & npm bin/ folder to PATH"-> choose the NodeJS installation.
4. Additionally, you can also setup multiple branches for the same job.
5. Click Save.
5. Test run a build - Go to Jobs and click "Build Now". The progress would be depicted as an animated circle. Blue implies a successful build and Red implies a failure.

### Analysis Task

#### Basic Analysis: The ability to run an existing static analysis tool on the source code (e.g. FindBugs, PMD, CheckStyle, NCover, Lint, etc.), process its results, and report its findings.

1. Go to your Job -> Configure -> Build Triggers. Check "Trigger builds remotely" and setup a token.
1. When the user creates a new commit to the repository, Git executes the script created for post-commit hook.
2. We trigger the build in Jenkins whenever user does a commit. Our script looks like:

#### Custom Metrics: The ability to implement your own custom source metrics.

1. Select your job and go to "Configure" option from the left pane.
2. This was done in Task1. If not, go to Build Triggers. Check "Trigger builds remotely" and setup a token.
3. In General tab, under Build sub-tab, select "Add a Build Step".
4. Choose "Execute Shell".
5. Here, you can write your script to be executed for Build process. We use NPM to install dependencies modules from package.json file and run tests during each build.

```
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm test
```

#### Gates: Using hooks or post-build scripts, have the ability to reject a commit if it fails a minimum testing criteria (e.g. failed test case, or less than 50% statement coverage) and analysis criteria (e.g. cannot commits that generate a particular FindBugs rule, such as "Method concatenates strings using + in a loop").

1. Go to Manage Jenkins -> Configure System.
2. Setup Extended E-mail Notification and E-mail notification. The below screen shows setup for Extended Configuration. Both the setups are same.

3. For both of the above, we configured gmail smtp server. 
4. Enter the SMTP details and credentials and click Save.
5. Follow below screenshots for reference.

   ![Configure Email 1]()
6. Go the Configure page of your job-> Post-build Actions-> Post Build Action-> Choose Editable Email Notification.

7. Now, when you build you will get the email notification for the corresponding build.

Note: If the recipient is @gmail, you need to turn on the security access by using the link https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps
